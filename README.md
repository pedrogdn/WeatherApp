# WeatherApp
User-friendly platform designed to provide real-time weather updates. Users can enter the name of a city to retrieve current weather conditions, including temperature, atmospheric phenomena, and wind speeds. The app interfaces with the OpenWeatherMap API to pull in data, displaying it neatly within a minimalist UI.
